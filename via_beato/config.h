The “permissive hold” mode, in addition to the default behavior, 
immediately selects the hold action when another key is tapped 
(pressed and then released) while the dual-role key is held down,
even if this happens earlier than the tapping term. 
If another key is just pressed, but then the dual-role key is released 
before that other key (and earlier than the tapping term),
this mode will still select the tap action
